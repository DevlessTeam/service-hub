# service-hub
The Service Hub hosts an index of all services available on the DevLess framework. In short every out of the box feature DevLess provides is hosted here.

## Getting your Services/Modules here
* Clone this repo.
* Edit the services-`version`.json where version corresponds to the version of DevLess the service is for
* Make a copy of an object from the json file and edit to suit the description of your service. I will inspect so be sensible
* Send in a Pull Request for merge 
* If everything goes smoothly, once merged your service should show up on the ServiceHub tab of DevLess.

Still having troubles hit me up `edmond@devles`
## Using Services/Modules 
Once you have (DevLess)[devless.io] setup you can install services from the Hub Tab within the framework.
